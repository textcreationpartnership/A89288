         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall very briefly tell you the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe or march of our Army, under the command of that thrice noble Generall Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax;</hi> for this laſt weeke, that may, as did his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all tend to the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victory obtained this fourteenth of June. On Munday June 9. the Army moved from <hi>Onely</hi> and <hi>Sherington</hi> thorow <hi>Newport-Pagnell</hi> unto <hi>Stony-Stratford</hi> and the Villages adjacent, and on Wedneſday night June 11. came to <hi>Wootton</hi> two miles from <hi>Northampton,</hi> on Thurſday to <hi>Kiſlingbury</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five miles of <hi>Daventry</hi> the Kings head quarter, where the Army lay in the Field, and that night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with ſome of the Kings Scouts, with loſſe of two of our men, and taking two of theirs, which gave the Alarm to the Enemy. About ſeven at night the King being hunting in <hi>Faulſely</hi> Parke, and had no word of the ſo neere approach of our Army, but as ſoone as they perceived the Generall drew towards them as if he intended to fight, they drew all on <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:113041:3"/>hill neere <hi>Daventry,</hi> and in all haſte indeavoured to get away; the news being brought to them (as a Country-man told the Generall next day) that Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides was comming to joyne with the Parliaments Army. About five of the clocke on Fryday morning the Kings Army began their march out of <hi>Daventry,</hi> and about nine the Towne was quite rid of them, they having kept on horſeback all night, and much running about amongſt the Foot to get the Carriages ready. That Firday morning came Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Cromwell</hi> to the Army as they were drawing out to march after the Kings Army, who took their way towards <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> The Horſe at the appearing of the Lieutenant-Generall gave a mighty ſhout for joy of his comming to them: A party of our Horſe were ſent to <hi>Daventry</hi> to know when and which way the Kings Army went, where they tooke divers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and that night marched to <hi>Guilsborough</hi> about ſixe miles from <hi>Harborough</hi> the Kings head quarter: the Van of our Horſe and the Reare of his quarter in three miles each of other untill day light appeared, where the Scouts on both ſides ſaluted one the other, and the Army prepared to march after the Kings to finde them out. The Kings men perceiving our neere approach, and that they could not march away ſo faſt as we purſued, having neere 300. Carriages of one kinde or other, they reſolved to take the advantage of ground on a large hill in <hi>Navesby</hi> Field, about nine miles from <hi>Northampton</hi> and three from <hi>Harborough;</hi> and were ready before wee could get to them; who found another Hill about halfe a mile on the South of them, equally commodious with theirs, about nine of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113041:3"/>the clock on Saturday morning, June 14. we joyned battell with them, with much reſolutions on both ſides; the Kings right Wing firſt charging our left, and driving them off their ground in ſome diſorder, our right Wing doing as much for their left Wing, the body in the meane while being ſtrongly ingaged, our Foot at firſt charge gained ground of the enemy, with ſome loſſe on the enemies part, but they being driven on by their horſe, at the ſecond charge drove ours to ſome diſorder, but by the care of the Field-Officers was ſoone drawne into a body againe, and by this time our left Wing had rallied againe, and the whole Army with one hot charge in all the parts of it did ſo beſtirre them for almoſt an houre, that they drave all the Kings men from their Ordnance (which before had not time to doe much execution on either ſide) and the right Wing following their advantage they had firſt got, put the Kings Army to a generall Rout, ſo that our Army drave them quite out of the Field Horſe and Foot, and that with ſuch ſpeed and earneſt proſecution, that no man can ſay yet, There was one of the Kings Foot got away, and but few of his Horſe in any order, though it be thought neere foure thouſand of them got out of the Field, but were purſued by our Horſe. By one of the clocke in the afternoone there was not a Horſe or man of the Kings Army to be ſeene in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> but the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Horſe being in haſte gone towards <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and our Foot were gathering the pillage while our Horſe followed the flying Enemy. I faw the field ſo beſtrewed with Carcaſes of Horſe and Men, as was moſt ſad to behold, becauſe Subjects under one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113041:4"/>government, but moſt happy in this, becauſe they were moſt of them profeſſed enemies of God, and the government of his Son: The Field was about a mile broad where the Battell was fought, and from the outmoſt Flanke of the right, to the left Wing, tooke up the whole ground; The bodies lay ſlaine about foure miles in length, the moſt thick on the hill the Kings men ſtood on; I cannot thinke there was few leſſe then foure hundred men ſlaine, and truly I thinke not many more, and neere 300. Horſes: Wee tooke at the leaſt foure thouſand Priſoners on the ground between <hi>Navesby</hi> and <hi>Harborough,</hi> neere three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Carriages, whereof twelve of them were Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, one drawne by twenty ſix Horſes, carrying a twenty foure pound bullet; they carried off the ground over <hi>Harborough</hi> Bridge (as I was told in <hi>Harborough,</hi> by one that ſtood to watch) but ſixe Carts or Waggons, one whereof was taken in the Towne by our Horſe, and the other about a mile off the Towne, as I was told; there was many of the Wagons laden with rich plunder, and others with Arms and Ammunition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50. loads of Muskets, Pikes, Powder, Match, and Bullets, a bundance of Trunks, which the Souldiers ſoone emptied, as they did the Waggons that carried the middle ſort of Ammunition Whoores, who were full of money and rich apparell, there being at leaſt 150 of that tribe, the gentiler ſort in Coaches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I only ſaw 7. Coaches with Horſes taken ſluffed with that commodity, and the common rabble of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vermin on foot, 500. of them at leaſt being taken and kept with a guard, untill order was taken to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them and their mates, many of theſe were Iriſh
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113041:4"/>women, of cruel countenances, ſome of them were cat by out Souldiers when they tooke them, there was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken above 1000. leire Horſes, and many Cows; they had robbed the Counrry of, beſides many Horſes with Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Piſtols, it falling moſt on <hi>Langdales</hi> men, who were moſt forward in the charge. Amongſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there is about 100. Field Officers, I was told, five that were ſometimes Parliament men, now were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and knowne gentlemen, they are ſecured by themſelves, with others that are knowne to be men of quality, one Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, that ſtood next the King, and cryed, hold your hands the King will yeeld his perſon, which while they did, hee got away, and ſo eſcaped for this time by getting over a Forde or ſmall Brooke that parts two Counties of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not take upon me to ſet forth the deportment of the Generall, Lieutenant Generall, and our Major Generall, all which in their ſeverall places behaved themſelves to admiration, nor ſing Encomions to the praiſe of this or that Colonell, Captaine, or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, though I acknowledge many deſerve as much as any pen can expreſſe, but ſhall now tell you impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our loſſe on the place, ſo near as I can: The truly religious Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> hath received a wound on the right ſide with a Musket bullet, piercing his Armour and body quite through, but as I heard the Chyrurgion ſay, it had not entred into the hollow part of his body, it is about five or ſixe inches between the hole it made going in and comming out, this wound he took in bringing up the Foote, where they were firſt diſordered, and yet led them up after he was wounded;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113041:5"/>there is great hopes of his recovery, and though for preſent he be full of paine, he manifeſts much chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an patience, ſaying, That though he might groane, he would not grudge under it; and taking my leave of him for that night, he called on me to beg of God a ſanctified uſe of that affliction for him; which I pray God we may heartily do, both for him and our ſelves. Colonell <hi>Jerton</hi> is alſo wounded, and ſo is Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> with a brace of bullets in the thigh, who gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged both the Princes before he came off; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Potter,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners of the Army, is alſo ſore wounded in divers places; one Foot Captaine of Colonell <hi>Pickerings</hi> Regiment ſlaine, a Welch man; And the Cornet to Colonell <hi>Whaleys</hi> owne Troope, a ſtout and godly man, as all that knew him affirme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50. Common Souldiers, as neer as can be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gueſſed. untill they come to bury the dead. Our Horſe it is ſaid are within few miles of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and the Foote this Saturday night quarter in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> our head Quarter bring <hi>Harborough</hi> this night, which was the Kings laſt our Army nor at all weakened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but by the acceſſe of Colonell <hi>Roſiters</hi> Horſe and Dragoones, the <hi>Northampton</hi> Troops and ſome Foot, with other ſupplies from the Aſſociated Counties, is made more numerous. The Generall loſt his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece in the midſt of the fight, yet had no hurt. The whole Army is very deſirous to proſecute the Victory to the utmoſt advantage with all faithfulneſſe, that if it may be, an end may be put to theſe ſad times. Which is the earneſt deſire of</p>
